This is a beginner-friendly To-Do List app that basically the same basic app that I created for activity 8 just wiht more GUI features which allow users to add tasks with categories, delete tasks, and store them in a database. it was created using tkinter and SQLite.
## Features
- Add tasks with categories (e.g., Work, Personal).
- Delete tasks.
- Tasks are stored persistently using SQLite.
